Setting up a Python environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Once you have the tool installed locally and have set up your python environment, you can install the packages needed to use the tool by typing the command (in a terminal window within your python environment):

::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

or,

::

    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the tool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
With the requirements installed, you should be able to run the tool by typing the command (in a terminal window within your python environment):

::

    python -m tool_code.combinator

This should create a runs folder in your project folder (i.e., where you have placed the tool and repository), unless one has already been created, where the results of the run can be found.

Note that the tool was written in a Python 3.8 environment.
